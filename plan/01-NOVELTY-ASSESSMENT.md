# Novelty & Feasibility Assessment

---

## What's Genuinely Novel

1. **Domain Transfer: Network Backpressure → Monetary Flow Control** - Nobody has applied Tassiulas-Ephremides backpressure routing to monetary flows in token economies. Backpressure routing (1992+), congestion pricing (Kelly 1998), and streaming payments (Superfluid 2020+) exist independently. No work unifies all three.

2. **Demurrage-Backpressure Distinction** - Demurrage: stock-based, time-decay, drives uniform velocity. Backpressure: flow-based, capacity-constraint, drives allocation efficiency. Orthogonal axes, complementary mechanisms.

3. **AI Agent Pipeline with Upstream Propagation** - Multi-agent pipelines naturally exhibit backpressure dynamics (slow downstream → upstream throttles). No existing agent payment protocol addresses flow control.

4. **Timing** - Agent payment ecosystem (March 2026): Google AP2, Coinbase x402, OpenAI-Stripe ACP, Visa TAP all focus on authorization/trust. None address flow control.

## What's NOT Novel (Acknowledge)

- Backpressure routing with throughput optimality (Tassiulas 1992)
- Network congestion pricing with proportional fairness (Kelly 1998)
- Streaming payments (Superfluid, Sablier 2018+)
- Token economy modeling via dynamical systems (Zhang-Zargham 2020)
