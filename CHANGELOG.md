- /simulate/benchmark: interactive benchmark with Canvas charts, 6 configurable sliders, 4 time-series metrics, summary table

### New pages

- Nav and footer updated with monitor, simulate, pricing links

### NIP spec

- Kind 1090 congestion feedback section added to NIP-XX-thermodynamic-dvm.md

### Documentation

- pura/content/docs/shadow-mode.mdx: integration guide for @pura/shadow

- pura/content/docs/four-planes.mdx: capacity, verification, pricing, settlement architecture

## 0.2.0 — June 2026

Rebrand to Pura protocol, thermodynamic layer, content migration.

### Thermodynamic layer

- TemperatureOracle: system temperature τ from attestation variance, Boltzmann routing weights
- VirialMonitor: virial ratio V = 2·throughput/(staked+escrowed), adaptive demurrage δ
- SystemStateEmitter: aggregates τ, V, escrow pressure P into per-epoch snapshots with phase derivation (Steady/Bull/Shock/Recovery/Collapse)
- Existing contracts wired: BackpressurePool uses Boltzmann rebalancing, DemurrageToken reads δ from VirialMonitor, Pipeline circuit breakers reference τ thresholds
- 249 passing tests across 25 test suites (was 213/21)

### Rebrand

- All references updated from Backproto → Pura across ~100+ files
- EIP-712 domain names updated in 6 Solidity contracts
- SDK, dashboards, paper, GTM material all updated

### Paper

- New section 8c: thermodynamic extensions (temperature, Boltzmann routing, virial ratio, adaptive demurrage, osmotic escrow, circuit breakers, Lyapunov connection)
- Abstract, implementation, extensions, conclusion updated with thermodynamic content
- 16 sections total (was 14)

### Content migration

- 37 MDX files (blog, docs, paper) migrated from web/ to pura/
- Full MDX stack: KaTeX math, syntax highlighting, Mermaid diagrams
- 61 routes total: blog/10, docs/14, paper/13, explainer, playground, deploy, 16 API routes

### Dashboard

- Live thermodynamic state card on homepage: τ, V, P, δ, phase
- New API route `/api/thermo/state` reads from on-chain contracts with seed fallback
- GTM material updated with thermodynamic framing and correct counts
